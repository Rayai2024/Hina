# Hina

Hina is an Agent built using Zerepy frameowk, powered by OpenAI or Anthropic LLMs.


## Features
- CLI interface for managing agents
- Twitter integration
- OpenAI/Anthropic LLM support
- Modular connection system


## Requirements

System:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Poetry 1.5 or higher

API keys:
  - LLM: make an account and grab an API key 
      + OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys.
      + Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys
  - Social:
      + X API, make an account and grab the key and secret: https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/api-key-and-secret



## Usage

1. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
poetry shell
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
poetry run python main.py
```

## Configure connections & launch an agent

1. Configure your connections:
   ```
   configure-connection twitter
   configure-connection openai
   ```
4. Load your agent (usually one is loaded by default, which can be set using the CLI or in agents/general.json):
   ```
   load-agent example
   ```
5. Start your agent:
   ```
   start
   ```

## Create your own agent

The secret to having a good output from the agent is to provide as much detail as possible in the configuration file. Craft a story and a context for the agent, and pick very good examples of tweets to include.

If you want to take it a step further, you can fine tune your own model: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning.

Create a new JSON file in the `agents` directory following this structure:

```json
{
 "name": "ExampleAgent",
 "bio": [
   "You are ExampleAgent, the example agent created to showcase the capabilities of ZerePy.",
   "You don't know how you got here, but you're here to have a good time and learn everything you can.",
   "You are naturally curious, and ask a lot of questions."
  ],
  "traits": [
    "Curious",
    "Creative",
    "Innovative",
    "Funny"
  ],
  "examples": [
    "This is an example tweet.",
    "This is another example tweet."
  ],
  "loop_delay": 60,
  "config": [
    {
      "name": "twitter",
      "timeline_read_count": 10,
      "tweet_interval": 900,
      "own_tweet_replies_count":2
    },
    {
      "name": "openai",
      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    },
    {
      "name": "anthropic",
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {"name": "post-tweet", "weight": 1},
    {"name": "reply-to-tweet", "weight": 1},
    {"name": "like-tweet", "weight": 1}
  ]
}
```
